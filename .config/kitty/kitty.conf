    # scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

    #: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
    #: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
    #: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
    #: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
    #: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
    #: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
    #: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position.

    scrollback_pager_history_size 50

    #: Separate scrollback history size, used only for browsing the
    #: scrollback buffer (in MB). This separate buffer is not available
    #: for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager program
    #: when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The current
    #: implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximatively 10000
    #: lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII text,
    #: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
    #: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
    #: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
    #: ones.

    # scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

    #: Fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after
    #: enlarging a window.

    # wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

    #: Modify the amount scrolled by the mouse wheel. Note this is only
    #: used for low precision scrolling devices, not for high precision
    #: scrolling on platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative
    #: numbers to change scroll direction.

    # touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

    #: Modify the amount scrolled by a touchpad. Note this is only used
    #: for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS and
    #: Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction.
